A mobile app for checking the reality of claims and rumours around the world and to help staying away from unreliable media sources. Let the truth prevail! 


It lets the user search for anything related to claims in the search box, and then the Google API it uses retrieves the data from the internet and shows it up on the mainscreen. It shows the different claims made related to the search keyword and also the reality behind those claims. Basically, its like a fact checker.
